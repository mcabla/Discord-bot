# Discord-bot
This is a simple discord bot build using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org).  
The bot has been tweaked for usage on the [Ideefix](http://www.ideefix.skghendt.be) Discord server.

### Run this bot by yourself
To run this bot, you will need to follow [this](https://discordjs.guide/preparations) guide.  
```
Note: The guide recommends you to put your discord token inside config.js.
      This however could result in pushing your private token to Github. 
      Our bot prevents this by requiring you to put your token inside the .env file.
      If you do not have the .env file, you can simply create it.
      Inside the file you should put the following:

        DISCORD_TOKEN=token

      Replace token with your own token and you should be good to go.
